# Churn_prediction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them.

In this notebook, we will create a simple customer churn prediction model using Telco Customer Churn dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). We chose multiple clasification models to model churned customers, pandas for data crunching and matplotlib for visualizations. We will do all of that above in Python.

We have the following steps:
1. Requirements
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data visualization
4. Features
5. Classifiers
6. Training and Testing the models

## Improvement Points
1. A better use of pipelines
2. Use GridSearchCV for hyper-parameter tuning
